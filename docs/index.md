# ESP32 AirPlay 2 Receiver

**Stream music from your Apple devices — or from any phone over Bluetooth — to any speaker, for about $10.**

This firmware turns a cheap ESP32 board into a wireless AirPlay 2 speaker. Plug it into
an amplifier or powered speakers and it shows up on your iPhone, iPad or Mac just like a
HomePod or an AirPlay TV.

No cloud. No app. Just tap and play.

!!! tip "Already have a board? Install it right now"

    Plug it in over USB and click Install. No toolchain, no downloads, no command line
    — your browser talks to the board directly.

    <esp-web-install-button manifest="/airplay-esp32/firmware/esp32s3.json">
      <button slot="activate" class="md-button md-button--primary">Install on ESP32-S3</button>
      <span slot="unsupported">Your browser cannot flash over USB. Use Chrome, Edge or Opera on desktop.</span>
      <span slot="not-allowed">Flashing needs a secure (HTTPS) connection.</span>
    </esp-web-install-button>

    That button is for a generic **ESP32-S3**. For SqueezeAMP, Esparagus, Waveshare and
    the rest, see [all boards on the flashing page](getting-started/flashing.md). Requires
    Chrome, Edge or Opera on desktop.

Your phone sees an AirPlay speaker on the network. The ESP32 receives the encrypted
stream, decodes it, keeps it clock-synced to the sender, and pushes the audio out over I2S
to a DAC. The DAC drives your amplifier. Full detail in
[architecture](reference/architecture.md).

## Supported hardware

Works with **ESP32**, **ESP32-S2**, **ESP32-S3** and **ESP32-C5** chips. That includes
plain dev boards paired with an external I2S DAC, and several integrated
amplifier boards:

- [SqueezeAMP](boards/squeezeamp.md) — ESP32 + TAS5756 DAC and Class-D amplifier
- [Esparagus Audio Brick](boards/esparagus-audio-brick.md) — ESP32 or ESP32-S3 + TAS58xx DAC/amp, on-chip DSP, Ethernet
- [Esparagus Audio Brick Dual](boards/esparagus-audio-brick-dual-dac.md) — ESP32-S3 + two amplifiers, active crossover, USB audio
- [ESP32-S3 + PCM5102A](boards/esp32s3-pcm5102a.md) — the cheapest route, no soldering required

ESP32-based boards additionally support **Bluetooth A2DP**, so anything that can pair with
a Bluetooth speaker can play to them when AirPlay is idle.

## Features

- **AirPlay 2** — appears natively in Control Center and every AirPlay-capable app
- **ALAC and AAC decoding** — handles both live streaming (Siri, calls) and music playback
- **Multi-room** — PTP-based timing for synchronised playback across devices
- **Bluetooth A2DP** — receive audio from phones and tablets (ESP32 boards only)
- **W5500 Ethernet** — wired networking with automatic WiFi failover
- **Web configuration** — set WiFi and device name from a browser
- **OTA updates** — update over WiFi; USB is only needed for the first flash
- **48 kHz output** — optional 44.1 → 48 kHz conversion for DACs and S/PDIF receivers that need it
- **Displays** — optional OLED or 320×170 colour TFT showing track metadata and progress
- **Hardware buttons** — optional physical play/pause, volume and track-skip buttons

### Limitations

- Audio only — no AirPlay video or photos
- One speaker per ESP32 board
- Needs a decent WiFi signal for stable streaming
