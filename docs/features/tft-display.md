# ST7789 TFT display

A 1.9" 320×170 colour IPS display can show track metadata over a full-colour bitmap
background, with a progress bar and elapsed/remaining time. Rendering uses
[LVGL 9](https://lvgl.io/) with `esp_lvgl_port`.

!!! warning "ESP32-S3 with PSRAM required"

    This driver is not viable on the original ESP32. LVGL 9 plus the AirPlay audio
    pipeline plus WiFi exceeds the internal SRAM budget, and a Wrover's 4 MB flash is too
    small once the audio stack, SPIFFS partition and LVGL assets are accounted for.

    `idf_component.yml` enforces this: LVGL and `esp_lvgl_port` are only declared as
    dependencies when the target is `esp32s3`. Non-S3 builds are unaffected — the managed
    components are never downloaded and the OLED driver keeps working.

    Tested on an ESP32-S3 N16R8 (16 MB flash, 8 MB PSRAM) with ESP-IDF 5.5.3.

## Wiring

| Display pin | ESP32-S3 GPIO | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SCL / CLK | 18 | SPI clock |
| SDA / MOSI | 17 | SPI data |
| CS | 15 | Chip select |
| DC / RS | 16 | Data / command select |
| RES / RST | 21 | Reset |
| BLK / BL | 38 | Backlight |
| VCC | 3.3 V | Power |
| GND | GND | Ground |

## Enabling

The display is **disabled by default**.

=== "menuconfig"

    ```bash
    idf.py menuconfig
    # AirPlay Receiver → Display Configuration → Enable display
    # Select driver: ST7789 TFT (320×170 landscape)
    ```

=== "sdkconfig defaults"

    ```ini
    CONFIG_DISPLAY_ENABLED=y
    CONFIG_DISPLAY_DRIVER_ST7789=y
    CONFIG_DISPLAY_SPI_CLK=18
    CONFIG_DISPLAY_SPI_MOSI=17
    CONFIG_DISPLAY_SPI_CS=15
    CONFIG_DISPLAY_SPI_DC=16
    CONFIG_DISPLAY_SPI_RST=21
    CONFIG_DISPLAY_BL_GPIO=38
    ```

## Background image

At startup the driver loads a full-screen background from `/spiffs/bg/background.bin` into
PSRAM and draws all widgets on top of it. With no file present the screen falls back to
solid black and everything still renders correctly.

No background ships with the firmware — one costs 106 KB of SPIFFS, which does not fit
alongside the web UI on a 4 MB board, and most supported boards have no display at all.
To add one:

1. Design your image and export a PNG. Any size works — it gets resized.
2. Convert it from the project root:
   ```bash
   python3 components/display/make_background.py <source.png> [brightness]
   ```
   Brightness ranges from `0.4` to `0.6`. Start at `0.5`; the ST7789 backlight is
   considerably brighter than a monitor.
3. The script writes `data/bg/background.bin`. Get it onto the device either by
   reflashing SPIFFS over serial with `idf.py flash`, or over WiFi:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://<device-ip>/api/fs/upload?path=/spiffs/bg/background.bin" \
        --data-binary @data/bg/background.bin
   ```
   Then reboot — the new background loads on next boot.

There is no web UI for background uploads; the device's web interface covers WiFi setup
and configuration only.

### Colour banding

The panel is RGB565, so red and blue carry 32 levels and green 64, down from 256 each.
Subtle dark gradients show **visible banding**, which is a hardware limit with no complete
software fix. Bold contrast and distinct colour regions render well. The conversion script
applies Floyd–Steinberg dithering, which helps a little.

If colours come out washed out, swapped or psychedelic, the byte order is wrong rather than
the driver — see the colour bar test in the
[display component README](https://github.com/rbouteiller/airplay-esp32/blob/main/components/display/README.md).

## Cover art

Album artwork is disabled by default because it can stall the audio pipeline. If you have
a TFT display and want it, see [AirPlay tuning](airplay-tuning.md#cover-art).

## Implementation notes

Non-obvious integration requirements for ESP-IDF + LVGL 9 + `esp_lvgl_port` — rotation
ordering, LVGL task core affinity, and DMA buffer placement — are documented alongside the
code in the
[display component README](https://github.com/rbouteiller/airplay-esp32/blob/main/components/display/README.md).
