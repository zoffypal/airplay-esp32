# SPIFFS filesystem

The firmware keeps its web pages and DAC configuration files on a **SPIFFS partition** in
flash, so you can update the web UI and DSP programs without recompiling.

## Partition layout

A `storage` partition is added to the partition table:

| Board | Partition size | Address |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SqueezeAMP (8 MB or more) | 316 KB | 0x5B1000 |
| SqueezeAMP 4M | 192 KB | 0x3D1000 |

It is mounted at `/spiffs` on boot.

## Data directory

`data/` in the project root holds the files that get flashed to the partition:

```text
data/
├── www/               # Web interface pages
│   ├── index.html     # Setup and control panel
│   ├── logs.html      # Live log viewer
│   ├── bq.html        # Parametric biquad chains (TAS5825M boards)
│   ├── hf.html        # Hybrid flow tuning (SqueezeAMP)
│   └── speedtest.html # Network throughput test
├── hf/                # DSP programs loaded at boot
│   ├── base-hf1-44100.bin  # Hybrid flow 1 base image (SqueezeAMP)
│   ├── base-hf3-44100.bin  # Hybrid flow 3 base image (SqueezeAMP)
│   └── tas5825m_fw-44100.bin # PPC3 dump, if you supply one (TAS5825M boards)
└── bg/                # ST7789 background image
    └── background.bin  # if you supply one
```

The `hf/` names carry the sample rate the DSP image was built for, and a 48000 twin sits
beside each. Only the hybrid flow base images ship with the repository; a PPC3 dump is
yours to export and drop in, as is the background image — at 106 KB it does not fit
alongside the web UI on a 4 MB board.

## Compression

`data/` is not flashed verbatim. `scripts/gen_spiffs_image.py` stages it first and gzips
every `.html`, so the image holds `index.html.gz` rather than `index.html`. That takes the
payload from 256 KB to 101 KB, which matters because the smallest layout gives SPIFFS only
188 KB — the pages alone overflow it uncompressed. Pages also load noticeably faster over
WiFi.

The image only ever stores the `.gz`, so the web server tries the plain name first and falls
back to `<path>.gz`, setting `Content-Encoding: gzip` when it serves one; browsers
decompress transparently. That order is what makes `/api/fs/upload` useful — an uploaded
`index.html` replaces the page that shipped, and deleting it again restores the built-in
one. The `hf/` and `bg/` binaries are read straight off the filesystem by the DAC and
display drivers, which cannot decompress, so they are copied through untouched.

Staging also drops what a build cannot use. Both DAC drivers keep their DSP images in
`hf/`, so each build carries only the family it can load: `base-hf*.bin` and
`tas57xx_fw*.bin` need `CONFIG_DAC_TAS57XX`, `tas5825m_fw*.bin` needs `CONFIG_DAC_TAS58XX`.
That hands another 24 KB back to any board without a TAS57xx, taking the image to 78 KB.

Both build systems go through that staging step. ESP-IDF runs it from `CMakeLists.txt`
before `spiffs_create_partition_image`, and PlatformIO — which packs `data/` itself rather
than using the image CMake builds — runs it from `scripts/pio_stage_spiffs.py`, wired in as
an `extra_scripts` hook. So `idf.py flash`, `pio run -t uploadfs` and the prebuilt release
binaries all end up with the same filesystem.

## Flashing the image

!!! warning "PlatformIO does not do this for you"

    `pio run -t upload` writes the firmware only. Without a separate `-t uploadfs`, the
    device boots but the captive portal and web UI are missing, which shows up as
    "file not found" during setup. This is the single most common setup problem.

```bash
# PlatformIO — firmware first, then the filesystem
pio run -e <env> -t upload
pio run -e <env> -t uploadfs

# ESP-IDF — firmware, partition table and SPIFFS in one step
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
```

**Upgrading from a build without the storage partition** must be done over serial. The
partition table itself changes, and OTA cannot rewrite it.

Once the partition exists you can update individual files over WiFi with the API below, or
re-flash the whole image over serial.

## File management API

Three HTTP endpoints manage SPIFFS files over WiFi without reflashing.

**Upload a file:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<device-ip>/api/fs/upload?path=/spiffs/hf/my_flow.bin" \
     --data-binary @my_flow.bin
```

**Delete a file:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<device-ip>/api/fs/delete?path=/spiffs/hf/old_flow.bin"
```

**List a directory:**

```bash
curl "http://<device-ip>/api/fs/list?dir=/spiffs/hf"
```

Paths are restricted to `/spiffs/` and directory traversal via `..` is rejected. The
maximum upload size is 64 KB.
